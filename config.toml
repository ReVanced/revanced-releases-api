This website provides a JSON API for ReVanced Releases ðŸš€

Changelogs are not included but can be found on the [ReVanced Repositories](https://github.com/revanced/).

The team also have a [Discord Server](https://revanced.app/discord) if you need help.

## Important Information

* Rate Limiting - 60 requests per minute
* Cache - 5 minutes
* Token duration - 1 hour
* Token refresh - 30 days

## Additional Notes

1. Although we will try to avoid breaking changes, we can't guarantee that it won't happen.
2. Make sure to implement a cache system on your end to avoid unnecessary requests.
3. API abuse will result in IP blocks.

Godspeed ðŸ’€
