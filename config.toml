This website provides a JSON API for ReVanced Releases ðŸš€

Changelogs are not included but can be found on the [ReVanced Repositories](https://github.com/revanced/).

The team also have a [Discord Server](https://revanced.app/discord) if you need help.

### API Endpoints

* [apps](/apps) - Returns all currently patchable apps
* [tools](/tools) - Returns the latest version of all ReVanced tools and Vanced MicroG
* [patches](/patches) - Returns the latest version of all ReVanced patches

There is no cache on this API because we trust our fellow developers to implement a cache on their end.

So please be kind and don't blow up the API with requests or we will have to block your IP address.

Godspeed ðŸ’€
